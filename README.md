Problem Statement: Food waste is a critical global issue, with millions of tons of edible food being discarded annually, while millions of people, including vulnerable groups like families, children, and the elderly, face daily food insecurity.

Introduction: In today’s world, food waste and hunger are pressing issues that demand urgent action. Each year, millions of tons of edible food are discarded, contributing to environmental degradation and economic loss. Simultaneously, millions of people, including vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and low-income families, struggle with food insecurity, unsure of where their next meal will come from. This stark contrast underscores a profound disconnect in our food systems, where surplus food goes to waste while countless individuals go hungry. There is an urgent need for a solution that not only bridges this gap but also promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and ensures that surplus food reaches those who need it most. By addressing these challenges, we can create a more equitable and efficient food distribution system that benefits both society and the environment.In today’s world, food waste and hunger are pressing issues that demand urgent action. Each year, millions of tons of edible food are discarded, while millions of people struggle with food insecurity. This disconnect highlights the need for a solution that bridges the gap between surplus food and those in need.

Solution:
To address these challenges, we present 'Food Rescue'—a comprehensive and scalable solution that creates a seamless connection between food donors and recipients. Our platform allows businesses to easily list surplus food, specifying details like type, quantity, and expiration date. Donors can schedule pickups or drop-offs, facilitating smooth coordination with charities and food banks. With real-time notifications, recipients are instantly alerted when new food listings are available, and our map integration helps volunteers find the most efficient routes for pickups. By offering impact metrics, 'Food Rescue' also tracks the amount of food saved, meals provided, and the environmental benefits, demonstrating the positive impact of every donation."
